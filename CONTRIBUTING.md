This list of rules is mandatory to fill in. Of course, you can miss something and there is nothing wrong with that, but the more rules you follow, the higher the quality of your help!

## Responsibilities

### Pull requests:

* Before creating a pull request, test your code! This is incredibly important!
* Clearly and concisely describe how your code works, what it does, and why it is needed (optional).
* Your code must be cross-platform. Before sending a pull request, make sure that the code will work on all platforms: **Windows**, **Linux** (any distribution), **Mac**

### Issues:

* Describe the problem you are facing clearly and understandably.
* Tell us how to reproduce the error (if possible). Describe in detail the steps for its occurrence.
* Please provide all important information about your system: whether Netter is added to PATH, what operating system you are using, etc.
* Tell us what you have already tried to solve the problem. This will reduce both your and our time to help you and fix the error in our code.


You can also add your ideas and wishes for the project to the issues list. Here are the rules to follow:

* Describe your idea in detail. What is it for, what will it bring that is useful and convenient, who will need it?
* Make sure your idea is not in the future plans (Features item in README) or your idea has not been suggested before: check issues for such an idea.

### Are you ready to submit your changes?

If yes, then take another look at your code. Check it against the project code style (code style). If everything is OK, follow the steps to create a pull request:

* Fork the project;
* Create a new branch and name it according to your code (functionality of the code);
* Add your code to this branch;
* Create a pull request in our project. Follow all the rules described above!

## First contribution

Don't know where to start? Check out the list of issues. The "Beginner" tag is just what you need. Issues with this tag usually require a small amount of knowledge, a couple of lines of code, and some tests. Tags for a higher level of knowledge may be difficult for you, but try it anyway! Sooner or later you will have to work on a difficult task. So why not do it right now?
